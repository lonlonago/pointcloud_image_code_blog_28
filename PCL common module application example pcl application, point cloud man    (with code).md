   pcl_common library contains common data structures and methods used by most PCL libraries. The core data structures include the PointCloud class and many point types used to represent points, surface normals, RGB color values, feature descriptors, and more. In addition, it also contains calculation functions such as distance/norm, mean and covariance, angle transformation, geometric transformation, etc. This module is independent of other modules and can be compiled independently. 

#  Header files in common modules 

 Angles. H defines the angle calculation function of the standard C interface. Centriod.h defines the estimation of the center point and the calculation of the covariance matrix. The standard C and C++ classes of common.h are the parent classes of other common functions. Distance. H defines the standard C interface for calculating distances. copy_point. H has a simple copy function file_io. H defines some functions to help write or read files. Random .h defines some functions generated by random point clouds. H defines some basic geometric functions. Functions intersection.h defines functions where lines intersect. H defines the standard C method to calculate the regularization of matrices. Time.h defines functions for time calculation Point_types. H defines the types of data structures for all PCL implementations of point clouds

  Application example: PCL point cloud centroid removal 

   The "mean" here represents not only the average of the 3D point coordinates, but also the average of the values in other data fields. The generic computeNDCentroid () function also implements this functionality, but it does so in an "unintelligent" way, that is, it simply averages the values regardless of the semantics of the data within the field. In some cases (e.g., for x, y, z, intensity fields), this behavior is reasonable, but in others (e.g., rgb, rgba, rgbl (labeled with labels)), it does not lead to meaningful results. This class is able to calculate the mean in an "intelligent" way, i.e., taking into account the meaning of the data within the field. The following fields are currently supported:
